# Wine_Quality_Analysis
*  **Problem Statement:** Predicting quality of wine 
*   **Method:**
    1.   Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find out correlation of variables to wine quality
    2.   Utilized Machine Learning models to predict wine quality
    3.   Evaluated performance of models and selected best model for deployment
*   **Approach:** Using combination of red and white wine data (Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository)
*   **Metric:** Measure accuracy and f1 score (i.e. precision) of predicted wine quality

**Conclusion:**
* RandomForestClassifier model has the highest accuracy and f1 score
* Accuracy : 70.34% 
* f1 score : 0.70
